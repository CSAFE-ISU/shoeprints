The REU data collected by REU students is in this project as well as other materials.

For this project, we require two other projects located in the [CSAFE-ISU github](https://github.com/CSAFE-ISU). Specifically, the [solefinder](https://github.com/CSAFE-ISU/solefinder) R package and the [solefinder-app](https://github.com/CSAFE-ISU/solefinder-app) shiny app.

### Install solefinder package

This package needs to be installed directly from Github since it is not available on CRAN. To install it, 

1. make sure you have installed the devtools package (run `install.packages("devtools")` in R console). If you are on Windows, you need to install Rtools first (download the most recent version [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)). 

2. Run `devtools::install_github("CSAFE-ISU/solefinder")`.

### Install solefinder-app

Go the its repository (https://github.com/CSAFE-ISU/solefinder-app) and follor directions.
